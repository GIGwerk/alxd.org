Since I've been focusing on other projects for some time, I totally forgot to mention my part in [Przemiany Festival](http://festiwalprzemiany.pl/) organized by [Copernicus Science Centre](http://www.kopernik.org.pl/en/) in Warsaw between the 1st and 4th of September 2016.

On a panel titled "Radical Life Extension" I disputed with [dr Grazyna Mosieniak](http://www.nencki.gov.pl/pracownia-molekularnych-podstaw-starzenia) from Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw. We presented transhumanist's and researcher's standpoints respectively, describing different strategies for regenerative medicine from within and outside of Academia.

We both agreed that public debate on aging should differentiate between _lifespan_ and _healthspan_. We talked about different vectors of aging research, dr Aubrey De Grey's movement as described in [Ending Aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ending_Aging) book, organizations such as [SENS](http://www.sens.org/) and [Methuselah Foundation](https://www.mfoundation.org/)

As someone involved in open science movement I repeatedly emphasized a need for improvement of research quality through [Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) and [Open Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science) strategies. I also began to describe a question of limiting the technologies after their development - should we allow medical patents extensions, or fight them, like [India](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/03/19/inside-india-indias-fight-against-big-pharma-patents-is-a-just-war/)?

The whole of our debate is available in Polish under `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDkpPccQLyk` or below:
