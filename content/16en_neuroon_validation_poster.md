Winding up the long-overdue NeuroOn's signal research together with Ryszard Cetnarski from Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw [(github profile)](https://github.com/ryscet/) we created a scientific poster summarizing our findings. We presented it at the 6th International Conference "Aspects of Neuroscience" [(link)](http://neuroaspects.org/) taking place between 25-27th of November in Warsaw, Poland.

Just as the research notebook itself is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/pawelngei/sleep_project) and licensed under MIT License, our poster is released as completely open, under a little bit more restrictive [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed) license.

Since our research wasn't criticized beyond data representation methods on the course of several months, it should be safe to assume that it's ready to present to a wider audience. On the course of the following week you may expect a full NeuroOn verification summary blogpost with results explained in simple terms, leaving no ambiguities regarding the device.
