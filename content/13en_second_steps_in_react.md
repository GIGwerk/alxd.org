For some time I've been using React JS stack in my professional projects at X-Team and I decided to share some knowledge. React is just one piece piece of puzzle, requiring Redux, React-Router, Webpack and Babel to create truly interesting architecture. I've met many people having problems with grasping that, struggling to go beyond simple component state of their application. Since I had similar problems learning this modular approach, I decided to give a short presentation on the topic.

Initially given on April 27th in a wonderful Noisebridge hackerspace, I updated it a little after React Europe 2016 and presented again at MeetJS Warsaw on the 7th of June 2016.

The presented application of React + Redux is just a simple view authentication method, which nicely highlights the simplicity of the architecture. All links - including "by then you should know" are clickable, so feel free to browse sources recommended by me. All code itself is either runnable or has a `pseudocode` warning on the slide.

Slides are available in an `iframe` below or at my [slides.com](https://slides.com/pawelngei/second-steps-in-react-auth/) account.

To learn more about High Order Components, head to [Andrew Clark's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD_judE-bXk) from this year's React Europe.

The closest thing to a live example is in the [react-redux-jwt-auth-example](https://github.com/joshgeller/react-redux-jwt-auth-example) by joshgeller.

If you didn't understand any of the React parts, I highly recommend [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html) and [SurviveJS tutorial](http://survivejs.com/).

Happy reacting!
