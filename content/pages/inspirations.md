When overwhelmed by the stupidity, ignorance and despair around me, I like going back to these just to regain some hope in humanity:

#### [How open source and local hackers helped stop Ebola epidemic](https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7561-how_open_source_software_second_hand_laptops_and_hackers_helped_stop_ebola_and_stopped_an_apocalypse)

During the Ebola epidemic in 2014 Sierra Leone was crippled as a country. There was no management system existing to coordinate all the doctors and international aid workers, the salaries haven't been paid for months, the riots were just starting. Several self-taught hackers took a little over a month to develop an open ERP system and a mobile banking platform which saved the country.

#### [Pale Blue Dot](https://youtu.be/p86BPM1GV8M)

A beautiful spiritual description of Earth and our civilization by Carl Sagan from [his book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot_%28book%29) of the same title.
