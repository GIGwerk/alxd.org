Slug: about

My name is Pawel Chojnacki. I'm a full-stack web developer, cybersecurity educator, open science and free software activist and a former [Warsaw Hackerspace] facilitator. 

I freelance as [ALXD](https://prod.ceidg.gov.pl/CEIDG/CEIDG.Public.UI/SearchDetails.aspx?Id=d9303664-0fe2-4dc0-aecb-797877c2d1ba). You can also check my [LinkedIn](https://pl.linkedin.com/pub/pawel-chojnacki/83/279/192) profile.

I highly value rationalist and humanist values and consider myself a [transhumanist]. I seek to live by these ideals, changing world around me bit by bit, day by day.

I have a background in basic mathematics, physics, neurobiology and neuroinformatics. I program mainly in Python and JavaScript.

You can contact me through my [email], [Diaspora*], or if you really have to, [Facebook]. You can be also interested in my [github] account, although I'm not developing anything worthwhile at the moment.
