Title: About me

Slug: about

My name is Pawel Chojnacki, and I'm a proud member of [Warsaw Hackerspace], and a full-stack programmer at [10Clouds]. 

I highly value rationalist and humanist values and consider myself a [transhumanist]. I seek to live by these ideals, changing world around me bit by bit, day by day.

I have a background in basic mathematics, physics, neurobiology and neuroinformatics. I program mainly in Python and JavaScript.

You can contact me through my [email], [Diaspora*], or if you really have to, [Facebook].
