My personal blog, dedicated to programming, technology and transhumanism. Although the main language is and will be Polish, from time to time I cover some national-only story using Polish.

It's a static site generated with [Pelican], using customized [Bootstrap] theme.

roadmap
=====
 - two languages support
 - better grunt/less integration
 - dark and light skins switched by buttons
 - making skin standalone for use by other bloggers
